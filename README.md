# Project Overview

This project is designed as a skeleton structure for machine learning and deep learning (MLDL) projects. It provides a standardized and organized layout to streamline development and collaboration.

## File Structure

- **`checkpoints/`**: Contains saved model checkpoints for resuming training or inference.
- **`data/`**: Contains raw and processed data files.
- **`dataset/`**: Scripts and utilities for dataset preparation and loading.
- **`models/`**: Model definitions and architecture implementations.
- **`utils/`**: Utility scripts and helper functions.
- **`eval.py`**: Script for evaluating model performance.
- **`train.py`**: Script for training models.

This structure promotes modularity, scalability, and ease of use for MLDL projects.
